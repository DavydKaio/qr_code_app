- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - For styles

### What I learned

It's always a challenge make the migrate from pure CSS to TailwindCSS, but I am
very glad to accomplish the challenges, principally working with media querys
and adding a custom font family. With React, it's wondefull working with him,
with small things like this challenge even great works. I love make the
components and how react works!

### Continued development

I need more practice, like everyone else. That's a lot of things that I need to
improve, I need learn more css to make my estilizations more clean and
beautiful, and get deeper in advanceds concepts of React. I wish to work with
this technology, I love it!
